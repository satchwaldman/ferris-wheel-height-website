  <h2>History of the Ferris Wheel</h2>
  <p>
    The original Ferris wheel was designed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
    Intended as America’s answer to the Eiffel Tower, Ferris’s invention stood 264 feet tall and carried over 2 million riders during the fair.
    Its innovative design combined engineering ingenuity with architectural beauty, forever embedding Ferris wheels into the landscape of amusement rides.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, Ferris wheels have become iconic symbols of leisure and wonder. They’ve evolved from wooden, steam-powered giants into sleek, modern structures
    using advanced materials and computer-controlled motors. Today’s largest observation wheels, like the High Roller in Las Vegas or the London Eye,
    offer breathtaking views of skylines and landscapes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ferris wheels have also found a place in science and mathematics classrooms. Their smooth, circular motion is perfect for exploring trigonometric
    functions and periodic behavior, making them not only fun to ride but fascinating to model.

  <!-- Dataset Info -->
  <h2>About This Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    This dataset represents the vertical position of a passenger on a Ferris wheel over a 30-minute period.
    The Ferris wheel has a <strong>diameter of 60 meters</strong>, placing its <strong>radius at 30 meters</strong>, with the center located
    <strong>30 meters above the ground</strong>. The wheel rotates at a constant rate, completing <strong>one full revolution every 3 minutes (180 seconds)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data was collected every <strong>5 seconds</strong>, starting at the lowest point of the rotation. Because the motion is smooth and repetitive,
    the height follows a <strong>cosine wave pattern</strong>, making this dataset ideal for mathematical modeling of sinusoidal motion.
